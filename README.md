## Overview of the school district analysis:

This project focused on cleaning, formatting, and analyzing school district data in order to determine how the schools performed. The district needed to know how to allocate funding to the schools based on how they had performed academically. The individual school size, type of school, and percentages of passing and failing totals were analyzed. After the final results had been presented to the school district, the 9th grade scores from Thomas High School were indicated as having cheated. The district had to be able to remove that school's results from the analysis report without affecting the other schools. The process used to reach this goal was to replace the 9th grade Thomas High School scores with NaN (Not a Number).
